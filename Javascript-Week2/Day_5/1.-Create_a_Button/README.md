  + The id is btn.  

  + The text is 0. Text is accessed using innerHTML property of js object.  

  + The widthwidth is 96px and the heightheight is 48px.  

  + The font sizefont size is 24px.  

  + After each click, the button text should be incremented by 1.

```

After the first four clicks, the button is:

```
4  
```

After five more clicks, the button is:

##Note

The js and css files are in different directories, so use the ```html<link>``` tag to provide the path of the css file and ```html<script>``` tag to provide the path of the js file:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/button.css" type="text/css">
    </head>
    
    <body>
    	<script src="js/button.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
    </body>
</html>
```
