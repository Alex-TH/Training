#Correlation and Regression Lines #1

##Objective 
In this challenge, we practice calculating the correlation between two elements.

##Resources 
Here are some useful articles explaining the relationship between rr and the slopes of the regression lines.

  1.- Correlation and R-squared
  3.- Khan Academy tutorial about the coefficient of determination  
  3.- Formula: r2 = bxy Ã— byx where the symbols used are the standard ones, given the context.  
##Task 
For a particular scatter plot, the line of regression of y on x is:

3x+4y+8=0  

And the line of regression of x on y is:

4x+3y+7=0  
Find the Pearson Product moment coefficient, r, correct to a scale of 2 decimal places.

##Output Format

Your answer should be a single floating point/decimal number, correct to a scale of 2 decimal places. You can submit solutions in either of the 2 following ways:

Solve the problem manually and submit your result as Plain Text. In the text box below, enter a single floating point/decimal number.
Submit an R or Python program, which uses the above parameters (hard-coded), then computes and prints the score.
Your answer should follow the format below, and must not contain any extra white space or newline characters:

```
4.23  
```

###Correct Answer
```
-0.75  
```
