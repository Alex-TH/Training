#Correlation and Regression Lines #2

##Objective 
In this challenge, we practice calculating the slope of regression lines.

##Task 
There are 2 series of data involving index numbers: P for price index and S for the commodity stock.  
The mean and standard deviation of PP are 100 and 8, respectively.  
The mean and standard deviation of SS are 103 and 4, respectively.  
The R2 correlation coefficient between the two series is 0.4.  

With this data, obtain the slope of the regression line of P on S, correct to a scale of 2 decimal places.

##Output Format

Your answer should be a single floating point/decimal number, correct to a scale of 2 decimal places. You can submit solutions in either of the 2 following ways:

  1.- Solve the problem manually and submit your result as Plain Text. In the text box below, enter a single floating point/decimal number.  
  2.- Submit an R or Python program, which uses the above parameters (hard-coded), then computes and prints the score.  
Your answer should follow the format below, and must not contain any extra white space or newline characters:

```
1.14  
```

###Correct Answer
```
1.26  
```
