#Standard Deviation Puzzles #1

##Objective 
In this challenge, we practice calculating standard deviation.

##Task 
Find the largest possible value of N where the standard deviation of the values in the set {1,2,3,N} is equal to the standard deviation of the values in the set {1,2,3}.

Output the value of N, correct to two decimal places.

##Output Format

Your output must be a floating point/decimal number, correct to a scale of 2 decimal places. You can submit solutions in either of the 2 following ways:

  1.- Solve the problem manually and submit your result as Plain Text.  

  2.- Submit an R or Python program, which uses the above parameters (hard-coded), and computes the answer.  

Your answer format should resemble something like:

```
4.23  
```
(This is NOT the answer, just a demonstration of the answering format.)

###Correct Answer

```
2.94
```
