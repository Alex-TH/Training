#Basic Probability Puzzles #7

##Objective 
In this challenge, we practice calculating probability.

##Task 
A firm produces steel pipes in three plants.

  + Plant A produces 500 units per day and has a fraction defective output of 0.005.  
  + Plant B produces 1000 units per day and has a fraction defective output of 0.008.  
  + Plant C produces 02000 units per day and has a fraction defective output of 0.010.    

At random, a pipe is selected from the dayâ€™s total production and it is found to be defective. What is the probability that it came from plant A?
